### Introduction
This is a minimalist plugin with exactly one function: Enables the issuing of gentle reminders as an alternative to strict warnings. Nothing fancy or complicated is involved. It only does the simplest task you ask for, and hence the performance.

Originally being part of [BattleAsya Utility](https://github.com/denniemok/battleasya-utility), this component was at first made as a little extension to Litebans, now made available separately with enhanced configurability.
